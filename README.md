# Assigned!

The tool the keeps your calendar and your new todo list in sync!

## Motivation

As a lot of us are, we live very busy lives. Some live only by focusing each day one at a time. 
And some plan their days in advance to keep the business from overwhelming us and worrying about what comes tomorrow.

I keep my mind sane by fully trusting my calendar as the day goes by. 
But, my calendar didn't just appeared that way, it required some planning by looking between my existing events and what was due in the near future.
How I've been planning since I graduated high school involves a todo list, which contained deadlines and prioritized lists, and a calendar, which tells me to work on some of the tasks that lived in my todo list 
(the tasks I "time block" on my calendar were tasks that required more than 5 minutes to complete).
This was problematic since my calendar didn't have a todo list and my todo list didn't appear on my calendar.
Thus, most of my Sunday afternoon consisted of me planning out my week making sure I didn't overlook anything in my todo list and double checking that I didn't time block for a task past its deadline.

And that is how Assigned came to mind.
